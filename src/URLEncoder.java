/**
Utility class for HTML form encoding. This class contains static methods for converting a String to the application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME format. For more information about HTML form encoding, consult the HTML specification.
When encoding a String, the following rules apply:
<ul>
    <li> The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" through "9" remain the same. </li>
    <li> The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same. </li>
    <li> The space character " " is converted into a plus sign "+". </li>
    <li> All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into one or more bytes using some encoding scheme. Then each byte is represented by the 3-character string "%xy", where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte. The recommended encoding scheme to use is UTF-8. However, for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is not specified, then the default encoding of the platform is used. </li>
</ul>
For example using UTF-8 as the encoding scheme the string "The string ü@foo-bar" would get converted to "The+string+%C3%BC%40foo-bar" because in UTF-8 the character ü is encoded as two bytes C3 (hex) and BC (hex), and the character @ is encoded as one byte 40 (hex).
